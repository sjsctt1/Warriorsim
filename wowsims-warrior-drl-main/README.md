# pywowsims
Python bindings for wowsims/wotlk

## Installation
Pre-compiled wowsims/wotlk shared libraries are included in the repo.
These will work if you host platform happens to match one of the target platforms these were built for.
Assuming your environment is compatible, you can run the example.ipynb and work with that as a starting point.

## Usage
See the [example notebook](example.ipynb)
